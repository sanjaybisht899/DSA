Same Problem as [[3. House Robber]]
But we have another condition.

All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one.

Hint:

1. We have going to use the existing solution only for House Robber its just there will be a small tweak.
2. We will be using two DP instead of one.
3. We will be calling the helper for 0 to n-1 and 1 to n so that it will exclude the corners when checking.
