For Notes

**Prompt:**  
I want interview preparation notes in plain text format.

- Language: Java
- Only give me problem-solving notes, no summaries or extra explanation.
- Start with:
    1. Problem statement
    2. How to solve (step-by-step text format so I can understand the logic)
    3. Approaches (brute force → better → optimal)
    4. If approaches are different, give steps for each
    5. Include recursive solution, then DP solution
    6. Add time and space complexity for all approaches
- Code: only small code snippets, not full code
- Keep explanations short, clear, and precise.
